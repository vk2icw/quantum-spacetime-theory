# 🧬 Quantum Spacetime Theory (QST)
*A new framework for emergent geometry and operator-level gravity*

## 📘 Summary
Quantum Spacetime Theory (QST) is a theoretical physics framework that reimagines spacetime as a quantum Hilbert space of entangled geometric states. Gravity is not a field or curvature but an operator acting on this quantum geometry. Time emerges relationally, and the theory makes testable predictions via Planck-scale fluctuations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
- Spacetime = entangled quantum system
- Gravity = operator on geometry Hilbert space
- Time = relational and emergent
- Predictions = coherent Planck-scale jitter
