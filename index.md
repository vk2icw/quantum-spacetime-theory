# 🧬 Quantum Spacetime Theory (QST)

Welcome to the public release of Quantum Spacetime Theory — a new approach to quantum gravity.

- 🧠 Spacetime is modeled as an entangled quantum system
- 🌌 Gravity is an operator, not just curvature
- ⏳ Time emerges from transitions between quantum states

🔬 Experimental proposals included
